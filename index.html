                <h3>Overview of project:</h3>
                <p>The CIP (Center for an Informed Public) has an enormous volume of data that has been collected for more than a decade. This data spans hundreds of targeted and ongoing crisis events and has been sampled and archived in various different ways. This capstone's objective is to make the CIP's research sharable, reproducible, and accessible which will help establish the CIP as a leading organization for social media-based research on misinformation and disinformation. The result of this capstone is a web-based library with test datasets and documentation on how the CIP can utilize the software as a starting point for creating the data library.</p>
