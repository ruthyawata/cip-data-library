Project Information
Project title: CIP Data Library
Project Abstract (108 words):
The Center for an Informed Public (CIP) has an enormous volume of data that has been collected for over a decade. This data spans hundreds of targeted and ongoing crisis events and has been sampled and archived in various ways. This capstone's objective is to make the CIP's research sharable, reproducible, and accessible. The result of this capstone is a web-based library with test datasets and documentation on how the CIP can start the process of creating their data library. The data library will help establish the CIP as a leading organization for social media-based research on misinformation and disinformation.
